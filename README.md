# CampusConnectAndroidApp
Android based DBMS project for 4th Semester. Uses SQLite as database. 

This app serves students and faculties to perform day-to-day activities on a registered course. 

Target users : Students, Faculties, Admin

Students can : Register a course(or courses), Start student discussion for that particular course, access course material links uploaded by respective course faculty, get announcement for that course.

Faculties can : Register a course, get course announcement, upload course material links, send test notifications for students registered to that course, access student discussion.

Admin can : Create/Delete a course, delete users(Faculties/students), Approve/reject registration of Faculties, add an announcement for particular course.


Note : App is primarily created for demonstration of Database operations. Since Database used is sqlite, so each user has to use same app to access their functionalities. But Sqlite database can be easily replaced with other server based database for remote access.
